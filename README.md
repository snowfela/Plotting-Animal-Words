# 🐾 Plotting Animal Words — Visualizing Language Patterns  

## Overview  
This project explores how **animal-related words** (like *dog*, *cat*, *lion*, *mouse*) vary in **usage frequency** across English texts.  
By using a dataset of word frequencies, it visualizes which animal terms are most commonly used, and highlights how language reflects cultural familiarity, symbolism, and metaphorical use of animals.  

---

## Objectives  
- Analyze and visualize the **frequency of animal-related words**.  
- Learn how to create **effective bar charts** and **sorted visualizations**.  
- Identify which animal names appear most frequently in text data.  
- Understand how **data visualization** can reveal linguistic patterns.

## Dataset  
**File:** `animal_words.csv`  

This dataset contains the frequency of appearance of several animal-related words in a large English text corpus.  

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `word` | The animal name or related term |
| `count` | Number of occurrences in the corpus |

## Key Steps and Analysis  

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
- Imported the dataset using **pandas**.  
- Checked for duplicates or missing values.  
- Sorted the words in descending order based on frequency.  

### 2. Visualization  
- Created a **bar chart** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Applied sorting to display the most frequent words at the top.  
- Enhanced readability with color palettes, labels, and rotated x-axis ticks.  

### 3. Insights from Visualization  
- Identified the **most frequently used animal words** in the dataset.  
- Observed clear dominance of commonly referenced animals like *dog* and *cat*.  
- Highlighted interesting outliers and less common animal terms.  

---

## Key Insights  
- Certain animals dominate everyday language due to **cultural relevance** or **symbolic use**.  
- Visualization shows clear linguistic bias toward **domesticated animals**.  
- Simple bar plots can effectively communicate **hierarchical relationships** in textual data.
